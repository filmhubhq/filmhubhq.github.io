We’re excited to announce the launch of Money. Filmhubbers will now be able to see earnings, download statements, and transfer to PayPal at their convenience — all on [filmhub.com](https://filmhub.com).

Some Filmhubbers may find an opening balance posted due to a variety of reasons such as (previously) incomplete PayPal or tax information. Just finalize your payment info in your account and transfer your money out anytime.

Please remember: Performance Insights only show trend data. Only Earnings reflect final money actually received from channels. For further information please visit our [Help Center](https://help.filmhub.com).
