Filmhub was awarded the “Most Impressive Tech Infrastructure Award” at Amazon Web Services startup pitch event in San Francisco. Amazon had previously selected Filmhub as one of the top 5 startups of the year, followed by an invitation to pitch at the AWS Pop-up loft in San Francisco.
Co-founder Klaus Badelt presented the company’s vision to an international audience of entrepreneurs and technology enthusiasts.

Filmhub and its award-winning cloud technology will also be featured in the Startup Spotlight series on the AWS Startup Blog.
