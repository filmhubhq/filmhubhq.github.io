> After decades of cross-pollinating with various genres and absorbing filmmaking traditions of other countries, the original definition of "noir" as 40s Hollywood crime dramas has become something trickier to define, but evermore fascinating. With many 21st century auteurs making their dent in the genre, we are now in a golden age of neo-noir. Here are 7 neo-noir gems in the Filmhub catalog.

## Motif

*Directed by Nadiah Hamzah \| Crime \| 2019 \| 86 mins \| Malaysia*

**Synopsis:** As Dewi dives deeper into her assignment to search for a missing teenager, she goes head to head against the girl’s father, Hussein - a splitting image of her own husband. Dewi prides on being a sharp and intelligent detective, but how does she persevere.

**What makes it special:** An Asian noir and a women's noir, Motif is bold and memorable in every way. With a stunning portrait of Malaysia's tropical landscape, well-written and well-acted women characters who endure and rebel, it's an ambitious and dazzling debut for director Nadiah Hamzah, and we look forward to her future projects.

## In The Land Of Lost Angels

*Directed by Bishrel Mashbat \| Crime \| 2019 \| 90 mins \| United States*

**Synopsis:** With time running out and desperate for cash, two Mongolian immigrants turn to crime as their only solution. They decide to kidnap the son of a wealthy businessman. However, once the deed is done the duo realizes that there is no turning back.

**What makes it special:** One of the first Mongolian-American feature films with a classic noir setting of Los Angeles - only more dystopian than the 40s. A rare crime drama that delves into the struggles of new immigrants and defies the model minority myth.

**Where to stream it:** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Land-Lost-Angels-Iveel-Mashbat/dp/B08V5479VG/)

## Hello Gangster

*Directed by Richard Krause \| Comedy/Crime \| 2016 \| 78 mins \| United States*

**Synopsis:** When Simon's dog is taken from him, he stops at nothing to get her back.

**What makes it special:** Seasoned filmmaker, editor, and visual effects artist Richard Krause spent no more than 2k on his passion project, and it's a tour de force of no-budget production. Think of an offbeat *[John Wick](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/245891-john-wick)* with less action but more dark humor and character study.

**What makes it special:** A regular feature on major Hollywood productions like *[300](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1271-300)*, British actor Andrew Tiernan returned to his home country for his directorial debut - a classic flawed detective story with a touch of occultism and sharp social commentary.

*Directed by Axel B. Steinmueller \| Thriller/Comedy \| 2016 \| 99 mins \| Germany*

**What makes it special:** Another micro-budget triumph that emphasized on the comedy aspect of noir.  Though a few jokes might get lost in translation, fans of the genre will appreciate the dark and hysterical humor and recognize parodies/homages of its American influences.
