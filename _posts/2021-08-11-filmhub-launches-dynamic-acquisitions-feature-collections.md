Santa Monica, CA - Filmhub, the dynamic disruptor in the film distribution space, is excited to announce their new product, Collections which helps Channel buyers explore Filmhub's extensive content library of over 10,000 titles. In addition, Channel buyers can now sort Filmhub's catalog with the new feature by various categories such as topic, theme, periods, places, and influences. This is all built on top of Filmhub's industry-defining licensing platform that allows buyers to license a film and receive delivery of the assets in one click.

"As we've talked to hundreds of buyers at VOD services across the world, one of their biggest complaints has been that it is impossible to sort through titles that are presented to them in CSV spreadsheets. Traditional distributors live off of these spreadsheets, and they simply don't work. So, similar to how consumers now browse their favorite streaming services by topics such as 'Visually Stunning,’ 'Festival Favorites,’ 'Stoner Films,’ 'LGBTQ+,’ 'French New Wave,’ we're now empowering Channel buyers with these dynamic tools to make their curation lives easier," says CEO & Co-Founder Alan d'Escragnolle.

Lloyd Scott, Head of Content at [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), was one of the early beta users of Collections and had the following to say, "With Collections, my job as a curator became much easier because I now have access to data-driven options especially curated for Plex. Rather than taking hours to find LGBTQ+ content for our Pride Month selections, I was able to find and license titles within minutes."
