> "Nationality is a Western concept. It was an invention of Western European scholars, who ever since have struggled to explain it", Jewish Austrian writer Joseph Roth wrote in 1927. Almost a century later, things make even less sense as we find ourselves in an increasingly turbulent and polarized world with nationalism on the rise pretty much everywhere. Through it all, migration remains a significant issue, and filmmakers have always taken a major role in the conversation. Here are 8 documentaries about the immigrant experience.

## Reunification

*Directed by Alvin Tsang \| Documentary \| 2015 \| 85 mins \| United States*

**Synopsis:** Filmed over a 17 year period, director Alvin Tsang reflects on his family’s migration from Hong Kong to Los Angeles in the early 1980s—fraught with betrayal from his parents’ divorce, economic strife, and a communication meltdown.

**What makes it special:** An all-time Filmhub favorite, Reunification is an artist at his most vulnerable exploring his own immigrant experience with great depth. Tsang's story is deeply personal yet profoundly universal, and all the more relatable when many of us are separated from our families by the pandemic.

**Synopsis:** Expert historians present this story of 4,000,000 Polish immigrants who came to the United States between 1870-1920 and worked in hard and dangerous jobs in Chicago's steel and meatpacking industries during America's Gilded Age.

**What makes it special:** All great American cities are built by immigrants. Poland-born, Chicago-based director Adrian Prawica's debut is a thorough and fascinating recount of a vital chapter of American history that's often overlooked.

## El Comedor

*Directed by Paul J. Durrant \| Documentary \| 2021 \| 20 mins \| United States*

**Synopsis:** At the border between Arizona and Mexico, there's a dining room like no other. Inside, some migrants eat their last meal before trying to cross into America. Others eat their first meal since being deported.

**What makes it special:** An unfiltered look at immigration on the US/Mexico border with eating and praying at its center. "It's not the question of if people are breaking the law or not, the reality is the law's breaking them", said Fr. Sean Carroll, the main subject of the film. During his time as the director of [The Kino Border Initiative](https://www.kinoborderinitiative.org/), what started as a modest dining room has turned into an organization that's providing food and shelter for thousands.

**What makes it special:** Not all immigrant stories involve some heartbreaking news. Aatif’s story is a reminder of what can happen when a community welcomes newcomers with open arms. A crowdfunded short film, Salaam B'y is uniquely wholesome and inspiring, and the landscape shots of "the rock" are absolutely breathtaking.
