    <h1 class="">Why we're different</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-usd fa-lg"></i> No upfront fee</h3>
        <p>No authoring fee, no signup costs, no hidden charges. Cloud technology efficiencies allow us to waive the upfront fees that other aggregators charge. Our philosophy is that Kinonation only wins when content creators win. Simple,  <a href="#pricing" class="animate">modest revenue sharing</a> only on success. Risk-free. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-ban fa-lg"></i> No gatekeeper.</h3>
        <p>Let the audience decide, not us. We are open to <b>any</b> content - feature film, TV, documentary, short, culture, children&hellip; any format, any genre, any language (subject to <a href="https://kinonation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201446026" title="For example, no adult material">simple minimum requirements</a>). Some outlets might decline your title - but we don't.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-chain-broken fa-lg"></i> Keep your rights</h3>
        <p>No exclusive contract. You are free to work with other distributors in parallel. No lock-in. No minimum terms. Cancel anytime. Exclude territories and outlets à la carte.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-cloud fa-lg"></i> Fully automated</h3>
        <p>Kinonation turns VOD distribution into a fully-automated all-digital workflow with a modern, easy to use, cloud-based web app. No shipping drives, no DVD screeners, no one sitting in a room full of equipment encoding each film manually. Upload unlimited size asset files. Comfortably resume after interruptions. We then author into all different VOD outlet formats.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-star-half-o fa-lg"></i> Discovery Guide</h3>
        <p>Our proprietary ranking system - built with a Harvard PhD statistician and filmmaker - ranks any title on a 1-100 scale of probable VOD success, based on 40+ empirical data points including talent ranking, festival &amp; social media, trailer views etc. This helps outlets select the most promising films - and the content creator understand how to improve their film's chance to be profitable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3><i class="fa fa-globe fa-lg"></i> Scale and reach</h3>
        <p>The technology and the zero up-front cost enables us to scale rapidly. We can ingest hundreds of titles simultaneously, from anywhere on the planet, into a huge catalog. And it allows us global and multi-language reach – to deliver titles to 200+ video-on-demand outlets worldwide, into growing markets, and in any language.</p>
