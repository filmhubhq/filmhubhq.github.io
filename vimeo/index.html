        <p class="lead">Exploit content worldwide</p>
        <p>Kinonation is working with Vimeo to enable you to exploit your film/TV/episodic catalog not just in the United States, but also on Vimeo VOD platforms globally. e.g. UK, Germany, Japan. Your content will flow to the Vimeo global platforms you choose, along with the required localization metadata (subtitles, poster art, description, alternate title, etc.) This is a great opportunity to exploit your content globally.</p>

        <h2 class="first-row">Vimeo DVD</h2>
        <p class="lead">Still a big market</p>
        <p>While the retail DVD market is declining in some sectors, it's still a valuble revenue stream for your film or episodic content. We're working with Amazon to enable you to select Vimeo DVD as a distribution option when you use Kinonation to get your content onto Vimeo On Demand. This will allow you to create DVD cover artwork & text, plus DVD disk art as required.</p>
